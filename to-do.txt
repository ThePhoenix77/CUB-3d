norminette



fix norminette in gun
create the necessary files
make the gun firing animation
fix the make file
fix the color parsing , first count how many commas u have, then check if the line has any unwanted character, then split it with ',' , then check the number if they are valid







for the mandatory part : fix the parsing ,i did add D in the map parsing, also remove the animation , and the doors , also the makefile needs to be modified
