Parsing:
    Valid chars (this is aplied only for the map, cause the textures can hold i big range of characters)
    check and store textures path
    check and store the floor and ceiling color
    check if the map is Valid
    Space char validity
    Map is indeed closed by walls












checki issue



fix norminette in gun
create the necessary files
make the gun firing animation
fix the make file
fix the color parsing , first count how many commas u have, then check if the line has any unwanted character, then split it with ',' , then check the number if they are valid







for the mandatory part : fix the parsing ,i did add D in the map parsing, also remove the animation , and the doors , also the makefile needs to be modified
